# NCL Tools and Tips
This repository exists to collect techniques and tools for competing in the [National Cyber League](https://nationalcyberleague.org/) competition.

To that end, there are a few rules:
1. We don't share specific problems and solutions here - even from the Gym. This is a public forum, and the NCL is a private competition.
1. Don't push commit or PRs to this repository _during_ the competition time periods. That would be [against the rules](https://nationalcyberleague.org/ncl-rules?rq=rules) of non-collaboration.
1. We don't worry too much about organization at first - we can curate it as we go!
<!--- Yes, I know those all say item "1". Markdown will "do the right thing" here and turn it into a numbered list. --->
