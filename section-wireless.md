# aircrack-ng

A Docker image containing Aircrack is available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/realmadsci/aircrack-ng) so it can
be quickly used by simply running `docker run --rm -it --volume $env:USERPROFILE/Documents:/host realmadsci/aircrack-ng` (for mounting your Documents folder as `/host/` when starting this from Powershell).
It is also fairly easy to install on Kali (`sudo apt install aircrack-ng`).
